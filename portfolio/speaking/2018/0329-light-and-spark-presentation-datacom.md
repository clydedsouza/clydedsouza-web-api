After completing a very successful Light & Spark NPO event in January, I thought of sharing my experience at Datacom in the form of a Developer Community of Practice (DevCOP) lunch and learn presentation. The outline of this presentation was to educate the audience about the event I had organized back in Mumbai, talk about what went well, what didn't go as expected and most importantly, what were the key takeaways from this event for me.
