I was invited to speak at the AUT Match Ready event that is hosted by Auckland University of Technology (AUT) as an initiative to help current ICT & Engineering students connect with alumni to get a glimpse of what a real-world experience feels like, what are employers looking for in candidates, tips of presenting themselves in front of prospective employers and much more. The event ended with an open Q&A session. This event was attended by roughly 30 curious students. 

Along with me on the panel were Senon Pinto, Madona Bekhit, Shane Birdsall and Sanjeev Morar. The event was moderated by Mandy Bunce.
