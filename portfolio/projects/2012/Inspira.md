Back when I was in college completing my graduation, I was approached by a friend to design a website for the BMS departments annual festival called Inspira. So, I teamed up with my friend, [Sagar Lone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagar-lone-4737449a/) to put together a website. 

At this point in time, we knew how to build a static website and test it locally, but didn't know how to host it live so it could be accessible to everyone. We started designing the website using Microsoft Publisher. Then, exported the HTML files from that.
