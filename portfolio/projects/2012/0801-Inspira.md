Back when I was in college completing my graduation, I was approached by a friend to design a website for the BMS departments annual festival called Inspira. So, I teamed up with my friend, [Sagar Lone](https://twitter.com/saglone) to put together a website. 

At this point in time, we had a basic understanding of how to build a static website and test it locally, but didn't know how to host it on the server and then make it live so it could be accessible to everyone. We started designing the website using [Microsoft Publisher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/publisher) and then exported the HTML files from that. Probably not the best idea as the output had all styles inline and wasn't responsive at all. Some graphics used on the site was designed in [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com/en-nz/microsoft-365/powerpoint). Only the contact us page on the website had some PHP code to send the contents of the form as an email. 

To help us out with hosting, we were provided with a contact who was responsible for acquiring the domain and hosting for the website. This person briefly explained the process and asked us to deploy the website files via FTP.  

Eventually, we got there. Everyone who visited the website liked it and we got a great real-world experience while still in college.
