For about two years, from December 2012 to December 2014, I was a member of my parishes editorial board responsible for putting together the monthly (sometimes quarterly) bulletin called Tulips that would then be distributed to all members of the parish. My responsibility was to put together a cover design for each magazine. 

Before each magazine was published, we would come up with a theme. I would then take the theme and try and come up with a visual to be printed on the cover page. At that time, I wasn't illustrating myself so I would pick up images from the internet and put it together using Photoshop (apologies for not giving credits!).

Overall, I really liked the process of challenging myself every time to produce a different visual that conveys the theme.
