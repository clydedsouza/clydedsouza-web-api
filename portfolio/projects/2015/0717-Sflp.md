This was my first ever hackathon here in Auckland, New Zealand. From one of the top floors of the PWC Tower, we developed a website for Success for Little People using WordPress. This event was hosted by Impact-IT on the weekend of 17th - 19th July, 2015. 

This was also my first time using WordPress. I and some other members in the team relied on another developer who knew WordPress pretty well and gladly guided us all so that we could understand and build a website for the non-profit.
