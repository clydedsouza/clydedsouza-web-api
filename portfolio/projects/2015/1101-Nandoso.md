The final examination of the [Microsoft Student Accelerator programme](https://twitter.com/nz_msa) was to put into practice what we learned so far. We were given a set of requirements and four days to implement a solution and demonstrate on the fifth day in front of the examiners.

Nandoso is an intuitive website for a fictional restaurant developed which includes Web API, MySQL database, Facebook authentication, Disqus forum and not to forget, a delicious menu.

I still remember the examiners reaction when I demonstrated this website - they were pleasantly surprised with the output and really appreciated that it was well polished.
