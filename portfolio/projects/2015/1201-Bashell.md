  was to experiment with the basics of web development to render the feel of a true
  terminal window. Bashell, like a true terminal window, has a set of predefined commands
  for you to have fun with.

Bashell is a browser-based terminal window running on JavaScript. The idea was to mock an actual command prompt and provide some sample commands like rolling a dice, calculating square of a number, printing today's date and time. Try running the `help` command to see what else you can do. 

It was a challenging project to accomplish especially getting the aesthetics of the application right. Returning the right functionality was probably the easy part!
