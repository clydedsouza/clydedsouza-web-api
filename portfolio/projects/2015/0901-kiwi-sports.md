As part of the [Microsoft Student Accelerator programme](https://twitter.com/nz_msa), each student had to create and submit a Windows Store App to qualify for the next round. I developed my first Windows Store PC app called Kiwi Sports which is an all-in-one app for the All Blacks, Black Caps and Silver Ferns. This app fetches data from API's to show images, news and videos for the All Blacks, Black Caps and Silver Ferns.
