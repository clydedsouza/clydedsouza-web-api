At an [Impact NPO](http://www.impactnpo.org/?ref=clydedsouza.net) event over the weekend of 6th - 8th November, 2015, my team and I developed a website for Huntington's Disease Association Auckland. Given the format of such hackathons, we are restricted by time and therefore, have to work quick. We start by understanding what the non-profit wants and then come up with the best possible solution. Usually, non-profits that attend these events want an online presence, so it's mostly the same drill every event. 

Most of the team had worked together in a previous event, so we gelled along very well. We put together a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) website for the non-profit and also put together some instructional videos for their team so they can self-manage the website later.
