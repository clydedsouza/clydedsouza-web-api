Luck Venue is a WordPress website developed by an awesome dream team at an [Impact NPO](http://www.impactnpo.org/?ref=clydedsouza.net) event on August 21st to 23rd August, 2015. Given the format of such hackathons, we are restricted by time and therefore, have to work quick. We start by understanding what the non-profit wants and then come up with the best possible solution. Usually, non-profits that attend these events want an online presence, so it's mostly the same drill every event. Eventually, the non-profit was happy, we made a good team, had good food, and enjoyed the weekend.
