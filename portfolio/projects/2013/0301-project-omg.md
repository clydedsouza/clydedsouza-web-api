A requirement to completing a paper during my graduation years, we were asked to team up and create a multimedia project. This could either be a game, video, an interactive app or something similar. I teamed up with [Sagar Lone](https://twitter.com/saglone) and [Biswajit Mishra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/biswajit-mishra-3bba78137) to develop a gamed title Project OMG.

Project OMG was an HTML-based game that presented the user with different scenarios and based on what you clicked, it would calculate points. These points were then totalled up and shown to the user as their _level of faith_ in God. 

This game was made using simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript and was saved as an [HTML Application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_Application) so it could be executed like an offline application. [VML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_Markup_Language) was used in the last page of the application to display the _level of faith_ as a donut graph. 

This was a great experience for the three of us to work as a team and develop something from scratch and on-time. We had to present this before an audience and also take questions. Some really good memories from this day will stick with me forever. 

Game can be viewed on request as it is not available online.
