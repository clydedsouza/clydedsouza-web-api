Hello and welcome to a Super Simple Introduction to Sass! My name is Clyde D'Souza and in this class I'll aim to make it very easy for you to take the first step using Sass. 

This class is divided into 4 easy to digest parts:
* An introduction to Sass. I'll keep it brief and cover when you might use Sass and when you might not use Sass.
* We'll look at compiling a Sass file into a CSS file. I'll show you an easy-to-use tool to do the same.
* Next, we'll start making use of some features of Sass and start by using variables.
* Finally, we'll take it a step further with partial files and I'll explain a bit more on that.
