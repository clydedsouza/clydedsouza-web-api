NuGet is the Microsoft-supported mechanism for sharing code. It is a definition of how re-usable code is created for .NET projects and bundled into NuGet packages. It is a tool that helps you create a NuGet package. It is a platform where you can publish your NuGet packages to and share it with other developers. It is a package manager that is integrated with Visual Studio which you can use to consume these NuGet packages. How amazing is that!

In this class you will learn how to develop your very own NuGet package and then publish it to nuget.org! Doesn’t that sound exciting? You will learn what is NuGet in more depth, how to align your thinking when taking the NuGet approach and a lot more.

This class is for you if:
* You’ve consumed NuGet in the past and want to learn how to develop and distribute your own,
* You’ve not consumed NuGet but want to learn what NuGet is and learn the entire lifecycle right from development to consumption,
* Or, you don’t want to learn about NuGet specifically but want to learn how to align your thinking while developing an independent unit of code that could potentially be reused, how to manage versioning of your code and a lot more that I would classify as 'derived knowledge'.
