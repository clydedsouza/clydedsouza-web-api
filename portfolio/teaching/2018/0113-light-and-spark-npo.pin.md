Light & Spark NPO's first event happened on the 13th and 14th of January 2018 at [Ramnarain Ruia College](https://www.ruiacollege.edu/Default.aspx), Mumbai. We taught 36 Computer Science students and gave an online presence to 1 NGO â€“ Healing Dove Foundation. 

I conceptualized this event remotely and put a team together to help me pull this event off. A lot of the pre-event duration was contacting NGO's, sponsors, and finding locations for the event. I  also had to prepare content that we would be delivering at the event and also had to train up the team to then be able to mentor students. 

The 2-day event itself was very fast-paced. We delivered presentations, then jumped into hands-on sessions where the students worked in groups to develop a WordPress site for the non-profit. Students in each group were paired so that they could learn faster, share knowledge and frequently communicate the whole time. There were a couple of graphic designers on-site to assist with any graphical requirements that any of the groups had. Representatives from the NGO were also on-site to talk about their requirements and what they'd like to get out of this 2-day event. We were aiming to give the students a work-like environment during these 2-days and having them communicate directly with other stakeholders was a key skill to learn. At the end of the 2-day event, each group presented their learnings and the website before the entire audience.
