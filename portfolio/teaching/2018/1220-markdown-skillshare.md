Markdown is one of the cleanest and easiest forms of writing rich-text content. Believe me. Once you learn the trick, you’ll wonder why you didn’t know about this before. With Markdown, you can go from writing simple readme files (that looks amazing, by the way!) to creating your own website/blog.

In this class, you’ll learn GitHub flavored Markdown (GFM) – a slightly more powerful version of regular Markdown – and by the end, you would have also created a one-pager website. Doesn’t that sound exciting?

Anyone who is keen to expand their horizon and is up for a new challenge is welcome to tune in to this class. No previous experience necessary (even if you’re not from the software industry, seriously).
