Light & Spark NPO's first event happened on the 13th and 14th of January 2018 at Ramnarain Ruia College, Mumbai. This event hosted 36 Computer Science students and gave an online presence to 1 NGO â€“ Healing Dove Foundation.

I conceptualized this event and put a team together to help me pull this event off.
